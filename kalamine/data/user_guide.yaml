Layers:
    base: |
        The `base` layer contains the base and shifted keys:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> | ?   |
            base --------> | /   |
                           +-----+

        When the base and shift keys correspond to the same character, you may only
        specify the uppercase char:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> | A   |
            (base = a) --> |     |
                           +-----+

    altgr: |
        The `altgr` layer contains the altgr and shift+altgr symbols:

                           +-----+
                           |     | <----- (altgr+shift+key is undefined)
                           |   { | <----- altgr+key = {
                           +-----+

    full: |
        The `full` view lets you specify the `base` and `altgr` levels together:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> | A   | <----- (altgr+shift+key is undefined)
            (base = a) --> |   { | <----- altgr+key = {
                           +-----+

Dead_Keys:
    Usage: |
        Dead keys are preceded by a `*` sign. They can be used in the `base` layer:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> |*"   |  = dead diaeresis
            base --------> |*'   |  = dead acute accent
                           +-----+

        … as well as in the `altgr` layer:

                           +-----+
            shift = " ---> | "*" | <----- altgr+shift+key = dead diaeresis
            base = ' ----> | '*' | <----- altgt+key       = dead acute accent
                           +-----+

    Standard_Dead_Keys: |
        The following dead keys are supported, and their behavior cannot be customized:

    Custom_Dead_Key: |
        There is one dead key (1dk), noted `**`, that can be customized by specifying
        how it modifies each character in the `base` layer:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> | ? ¿ | <----- 1dk, shift+key
            base --------> | / ÷ | <----- 1dk, key
                           +-----+

        When the base and shift keys correspond to the same accented character, you may
        only specify the lowercase accented char in the `base` layer:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> | A   | <----- (1dk, shift+key = À)
            (base = a) --> |   à | <----- 1dk, key = à
                           +-----+

        You may also chain dead keys by specifying a dead key in the `1dk` layer:

                           +-----+
            shift -------> | G   |
            (base = g) --> |  *µ | <----- 1dk, key = dead Greek
                           +-----+

        **Warning:** chained dead keys are not supported by MSKLC, and KbdEdit will be
        required to build a Windows driver for such a keyboard layout.

Space_Bar: |
    Kalamine descriptor files have an optional section to define specific behaviors
    of the space bar in non-base layers:

        [spacebar]
        shift       = "\u202f"  # NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE
        altgr       = "\u0020"  # SPACE
        altgr_shift = "\u00a0"  # NO-BREAK SPACE
        1dk         = "\u2019"  # RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
        1dk_shift   = "\u2019"  # RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK

    Kalamine doesn’t support non-space chars on the `base` layer for the space bar.
    Space characters outside of the space bar are not supported either.
