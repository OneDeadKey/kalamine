Contributing to Kalamine
================================================================================


Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After checking out the repository, you can install kalamine and its development dependencies like this:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user .[dev]
```

Which is the equivalent of:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user -e .
python3 -m pip install --user build black isort ruff pytest mypy types-PyYAML pre-commit
```

And if you prefer the old-school way, thereâ€™s a Makefile recipe for that:

```bash
make dev
```


Code Formating
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We rely on [black][1] and [isort][2] for that, with their default configurations:

```bash
black kalamine
isort kalamine
```

Old-school alternative:

```bash
make format
```

Code Linting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We rely on [ruff][3] and [mypy][4] for that, with their default configurations:

```bash
black --check --quiet kalamine
isort --check --quiet kalamine
ruff kalamine
mypy kalamine
```

Old-school alternative:

```bash
make lint
```

Many linting errors can be fixed automatically:

```bash
ruff --fix kalamine
```

Unit Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We rely on [pytest][5] for that, but the sample layouts must be built by
kalamine first:

```bash
python3 -m kalamine.cli make layouts/*.toml
pytest
```

Old-school alternative:

```bash
make test
```

Before Committing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then we strongly advise you to setup a git pre-commit hook that check things that will be checked by contnuous integration on GitHub.

This is asking git to run the above commands before any commit is created, and to abort the commit if any of them fail.

The fancy way to do this relies on `pre-commit` and `node.js`:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Old-school alternative, create an executable file `.git/hooks/pre-commit` containing:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
make
```
